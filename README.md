This repository is for my Data engineering career path. I am using ChatGPT as a coach to guide me from level 1: Foundational to level 3: Data Engineer. 
My learning structure:
- 2 hours per weekday
- 4-6 hours per Saturday and Sunday
- ChatGPT determines what I learn and practice (Yes, I trust it to be my coach for this career readiness path).

My learning environement:
- WSL: Ubuntu
- JupyterLab
- Python
- Git

Why Learn Data Engineering:

- I like the idea of working in the shadows to orchestrate the data flow that powers the world. 
- I want to prove to myself that I can learn something technical. 
- I want to prove to myself that I can be disciplined and focused despite haven completed college.
